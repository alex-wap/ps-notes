vice president  
|           |             |
team lead   consultant    team lead
|  |    |                   |     |
[] []   []                  []    []

each line is a unique chain that leads back to the vice president 
root - top node (head)
leaf node - terminal node
children
parent
each node has ONLY ONE parent (tree definition)

binary tree 
0, 1, or 2 children
left, right child
at MOST TWO children 

binary search tree 
SORTED
smallest left, biggest right 

add data
- recursive algo 
- cases
  1. empty - becomes root
  2. smaller - recursively add to left
  3. larger - recurisvely add to the right 
  4. equal value? - (treat it as larger)

fast search (duh)

remove 
- find note to be deleted 
  - if does not exist, exit 
- left node 
  - remove parent's pointer to deleted node 
- non-leaf node 
  - find the child to replace the deleted node 
  - three scenarios
    - no right child 
      - left child replaces removed node
    - removed right child has no left child 
      - right child replaces removed node 
    - removed right child has left child 
      - find right's LEFT most child 
      - promote to deleted slot
